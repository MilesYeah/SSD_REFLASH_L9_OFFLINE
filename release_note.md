# Release notice

You will need git to get the latest code from SW lab server through below command.


* [SSD_REFLASH_L9_OFFLINE on GitHub](https://github.com/MilesYeah/SSD_REFLASH_L9_OFFLINE)
* Command to clone: 
  * `git clone https://github.com/MilesYeah/SSD_REFLASH_L9_OFFLINE.git`
* Command to update: 
  * `git pull origin main`



<!-- ## Developer actions on each release
1. Make a copy of SSD_LIST.txt from **\\10.86.8.50\Share\TEST\FA\Yu\SSD_REFLASH_L9_OFFLINE.203.1**
2. Add **DSG L9 FW control table** in Doc folder.
3. Generate release_note.html before commit. 
-->



## **Must read on each release**
1. Be sure your system is connected to Internet, so the code update can be downloaded through Git.
2. After getting new version package, below actions need to be done:
   1. Be sure you have checked tool versions in defined in below **tool_versions**.
      1. If the tool versions don't match the definitions, update the tool accordingly.
   2. Check section **history** to get the latest change note.
   3. Replace the whole package in production environment, actually you can clone or update the code directly through Git.
   4. Be sure the **SSD_LIST.txt** is generated and updated strictly base on **DSG L9 FW control table** from intel.
   5. Be sure any update or deletion of standalone drive FW image are done, the firmware image files are now stored in **folder firmware_image**.
      1. When new FW image is provided, create a folder named after firmware version, extract the firmware package and copy all the content from the extracted package to the newly created folder.
      2. If a standalone FW image is deprecated, remove the folder from firmware_image.
      3. Make some note to introduce current FW image if possible.
3. Please commit issues if any, and send me the log files after verification.

2. **intel-mas-cli-tool-linux-1-9** has been released, **VDV10182** and **L0310200** are in support list. So Intel MAS needs a update to version **1.9.147**
3. Add function to disconnect drives as soon as drives are successfully updated to expected firmware version. Beta, to be verified in real production environment. 
4. After firmware update, the system would shutdown automatically. In case OP rmoves drives while the system is in a powered on status which would damage the drives.



#### version 206.4: 2021/06/028
1. `intelmas-1.8` is required as `DSG L9 FW control table_Jun2021.xlsx` is released, in which several new SSD series were added that need `intelmas-1.8`.
2. A warning is that SSDs in above warning section have `No Firmware Update Available`, 
   1. a Email has been sent to Intel for comfirmation about how to handle the FW when they are not expected.
   2. Reply from Intel **If the SSD show ‚ÄúNo Firmware Update Available‚Äù, we don‚Äôt need to update it.  Once find SSD in this case don‚Äôt match the FW control table, you can report.**
3. Fixed a bug to checking tool versions. This is a new feature to prevent unexpected tool version applied. 
4. Add some better log recording.


#### version 205.1: 2021/05/13
1. Add function to check versions for intelmas, isdct, isdcm, if the tool version doesn't match the required, the process would pause running and prompt that the tool needs a update.



#### version 204.1: 2021/05/06
1. **RE: L9 RAID/SSD/NIC FW Control Table for DSG Prods -2021 May** has been released, and there are 3 updates to SSDs.
   1. IntelMAS needs a update to version **intelmas-1.7.130-0.x86_64**, so the 3 SSDs get expected update.



#### version 203.2: 2021/04/13
1. PE Brady reported E2010487 cannot be updated through intelmas and he has successfully updated the firmware through isdcm on P4800x. 
   1. On **L9 RAID/SSD/NIC FW Control Table for DSG Prods -2021 Apr**, Intel Jonny confirmed standalone FW image can be loaded through isdcm. 
   2. Switch back to isdcm instead of intelmas.



#### version 203.1: 2021/04/07
1. P4800X and P4801X series now needs firmware E2010487, use intelmas to load standalone firmware.
2. Firmware image files are now sotred in folder firmware_image, add folder E2010487 in firmware_image folder.


#### version 202.4: 2021/03/10
1. Move tool version definations and history to here per PE's requests.
2. Refactor package folder structure.

#### version 202.2: 2021/03/02
1. intelmas is now mainly used to update FW for normal drives, issdct is depracated and we cannot find it from ark.intel.com.
2. A more detailed log will be generated in log folder and more details will be shown on terminal while performing the process.
3. Verified on production line.


#### version 201.1: 2021/01/28
1. Add check for drive status, if it is abnormal, record a abormal message in log file.


#### version 201.0: 2020/12/11
1. Owner of this package has been transfered from Intel to MSL SW.
2. Add ProductFamily while detecting product list.
3. While updating FW, D5-P4618 series SSD would use isdct to update FW and the rest would use intelmas.
